								<p>
									Since re-watching Avatar: the last airbender as an adult I have been inspired to make a game where you manipulate the elements through martial arts.<br/> 
									After many design iterations to figure out how a system like that would work whilst also being entertaining I decided on a fighting game.
								</p>

								<p>
									Unlike a standard fighting game where the perspective is in 2D and the characters stand close to each other, Flow is in 3D and the characters are 
									positioned much further away, this is because all the combat consists of casting ranged abilities based on the element selected at the beginning of the match.
								</p>

								<div class="row">
									<div class="column">
										<img class="standard" src="img/AbilityConceptSketch.png" alt="A rough digital sketch of how abilities are used"/>
									</div>
									<div class="column">
										<p>
											To use abilities in Flow players will select moves assigned to the top three face buttons, the abilities assigned to these buttons are context 
											sensitive and changed based on what stance the player is in.
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>

								<p>
									As an example: the player will enter the defence stance with the Right Trigger, while held the face buttons will have all the defence type moves, pressing 
									circle in this example will cause the character to raise a wall of stone from the ground, the player can then enter the attack stance with the left trigger, 
									push the square button and perform the push action, propelling the wall forward.
								</p>

								<p>
									In this game I want to the player to be constantly thinking of the best combinations of moves for a situation, being able to correctly defend against an 
									opponent's attacks while also performing their own.
