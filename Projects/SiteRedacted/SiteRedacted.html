								<p>SCP: Site [REDACTED] (formally SCP: Security Breach) is a project I’ve been putting together in my head for a few years now, originally (and maybe in the future) 
									it would have been a VR title to really immerse the player in the facility and the world that the community of the <a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/" target="_blank">SCP wiki </a> have created, but VR is still a new 
									technology, and for an inexperienced developer, jumping immediately into a VR project would have quickly led to confusion then to frustration then to burnout, 
									instead I decided to create the prototype as a flat-screen game to work out all the systems and establish a foundation to build off when I eventually do take 
									the plunge into Virtual Reality development.</p>

								<h2>The Security Guard Genre.</h2>
								<p>The core gameplay is inspired by <b>Scott Cawthon's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/319510/Five_Nights_at_Freddys/" target="_blank">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></b>, an indie horror title released in 2014.  The game takes place in a fictional Pizzaria 
									that uses Animatronic mascots, styled after real life American diners such as <b>Chuck E. Cheese's</b>, the player takes the role of an overnight security guard 
									to watch over the animatronics, during gameplay, these animatronics become hostile and will attempt to reach the security office and attack the player.  
									To survive, the player is given access to various security cameras to track the locations of the animatronics and two doors that can be closed, to prevent the 
									player from simply closing both doors and waiting until the timer reaches 6am a limited resource of power is used which the doors draw from, if the power runs 
									out, the player is left vulnerable and is usually attacked shortly, cue jump scare and loud scream (from me).</p>
								<p>What fascinates me about this game series is the unique take on survival horror by taking away a core mechanic of most other survival horror games: the ability 
									to navigate the environment. </p>

								<blockquote>It's a remarkable recreation of the kind of logic one encounters in a nightmare, Paralyzed by this encroaching<br/>
									horror only you seem to recognize as such but cannot escape from - <em> Ben Croshaw, The Escapist.</em></blockquote>

								<p>Similar to how Dark Souls spawned the <b>Souls-like</b>, Rouge spawned the <b>Rouge-like</b>, and Castlevania & Metroid spawned the <b>Metroidvania</b>, I think Scott has also created a new genre of survival 
									horror, i’m personally calling it <b>‘FnaF-like’</b> but i’ll leave it to the various youtube personalities and Reddit commenters to come up with an official name.</p>
